# Introduction

Hello! My name is Michael Tang-Tran. I am an aspiring professional hoping to break into tech. 
I have experience working in fast-paced environments to help customers and colleagues to reach their goals.
During COVID, I had to take a career break to take care of personal and family issues. I went back to school but it became apparent that I needed more work experience to make an actual difference.
